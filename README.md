# Expo CLI Unexpected Error: Command Not Found or Unsupported Feature

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: unexpected errors resulting from using unsupported features or deprecated commands. The error message often lacks specific details, making debugging challenging.  This example focuses on scenarios where a command is unavailable or a feature is incompatible with the installed Expo CLI version.

## Reproducing the Bug

1.  Ensure you have an older version of Expo CLI installed. You can check the version with `expo -v`.
2.  Attempt to run a command or use a feature known to be introduced in a more recent version (e.g., `expo prebuild --platform web` with an older CLI).
3. Observe the unexpected error message.

## Solution

The most effective solution is typically to update your Expo CLI to the latest stable version:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
# or
yarn global add expo-cli
```
After updating, retry the command or feature. If the issue persists, check the Expo documentation for compatibility information.
