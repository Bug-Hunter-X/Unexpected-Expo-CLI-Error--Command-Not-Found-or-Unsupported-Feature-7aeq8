The primary solution is updating the Expo CLI to its latest version.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli //or
yarn global add expo-cli
```

After updating, verify the CLI version with `expo -v` and retry the command that previously caused the error. 

If the problem persists after updating,  the issue might be due to other factors such as project configuration problems, dependency conflicts, or environmental issues.  Refer to Expo's official documentation and community forums for troubleshooting further.  Consider providing more detailed error logs for more specific solutions.
